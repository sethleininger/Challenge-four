# Challenge-four

The HTML and the CSS for this project is pretty short and sweet. No real flare, basic framework in HTML. 

In script most consts for my elements are defined at the beggining to refer back too. The welcome screen is instructions for the game and jscript starts running once the "Start Quiz" button is pushed.

The timer for the game is set to a count of 80secs, countdown is set to 1000msecs, and is set to end the game once it reaches 0. There is also a function that decreases the time by 10secs after wrong answers are selected in the game.
